## Good practices and code style

This project follows several standards and patterns to ensure clean, maintainable and scalable code, making it easier for anyone to contribute and understand.

### Commits patterns

1.  Use a prefix for every commit. Commomn prefixes include:

- feat: → for new features
- fix: → for bug fixes
- refactor: → for code restructuring without changing functionality
- docs: → for documentation changes
- style: → for formatting or code style adjustments

2.  Keep commits focused: Each commit should address only one clear purpose.
    Avoid large, mixed commits — instead, split them into smaller and well-defined ones.
3.  Write meaningful commit messages:
    - **Bad:** fix stuff
    - **Good:** fix: resolve user authentication token validation issue

### Coding patterns

1. **Always** use the command `npm run format` to format your code before commiting. This ensures consistent code style across the entire project.
2. Keep logic where it belongs. There **shouldn't** be a component on the hooks folder.
3. Write error proof code. Assume that anything that can fail will fail.
   Use try/catch blocks when dealing with asynchronous code or external resources like API calls.
4. Avoid unecesseary variables. If a value is only used once or is easily readable inline, don’t assign it to a variable.
5. Keep functions small and focused: Each function should do one thing well.
   If a function is getting too long or has multiple responsibilities, break it into smaller helper functions.
6. Take a look in the existing code. Try to not diverge too much about the current style.
